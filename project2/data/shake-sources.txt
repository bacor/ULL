That every word doth almost tell my name , <EOS>
So I return rebuked to my content , <EOS>
The basest weed outbraves his dignity : <EOS>
Of hand , of foot , of lip , of eye , of brow , <EOS>
Incapable of more , replete with you , <EOS>
But that your trespass now becomes a fee , <EOS>
Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score , <EOS>
And they are rich , and ransom all ill deeds . <EOS>
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight , <EOS>
Triumph in love , flesh stays no farther reason , <EOS>
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave , <EOS>
That I an accessary needs must be , <EOS>
Mine eye , my heart thy picture 's sight would bar , <EOS>
Came tripping by , but in her maiden hand , <EOS>
My bonds in thee are all determinate . <EOS>
Why should poor beauty indirectly seek , <EOS>
Hath motion , and mine eye may be deceived . <EOS>
All losses are restored , and sorrows end . <EOS>
So true a fool is love , that in your will , <EOS>
By unions married do offend thine ear , <EOS>
Against strange maladies a sovereign cure : <EOS>
As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back , <EOS>
And Time that gave , doth now his gift confound . <EOS>
Till my bad angel fire my good one out . <EOS>
Gored mine own thoughts , sold cheap what is most dear , <EOS>
That did not better for my life provide , <EOS>
When swift extremity can seem but slow ? <EOS>
When I was wont to greet it with my lays , <EOS>
You to your beauteous blessings add a curse , <EOS>
And that which governs me to go about , <EOS>
Possessing or pursuing no delight <EOS>
But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be ? <EOS>
To-morrow sharpened in his former might . <EOS>
O no , it is an ever-fixed mark <EOS>
O how I faint when I of you do write , <EOS>
Your monument shall be my gentle verse , <EOS>
Thy registers and thee I both defy , <EOS>
From sullen earth ) sings hymns at heaven 's gate , <EOS>
Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair , <EOS>
Then others , for the breath of words respect , <EOS>
When I was certain o'er incertainty , <EOS>
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see , <EOS>
Creep in 'twixt vows , and change decrees of kings , <EOS>
And that your love taught it this alchemy ? <EOS>
Full charactered with lasting memory , <EOS>
But be contented when that fell arrest , <EOS>
Than that , which on thy humour doth depend . <EOS>
His beauty shall in these black lines be seen , <EOS>
O benefit of ill , now I find true <EOS>
A loss in love that touches me more nearly . <EOS>
Farewell ! thou art too dear for my possessing , <EOS>
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee , <EOS>
A dearer birth than this his love had brought <EOS>
And rather make them born to our desire , <EOS>
So great a sum of sums yet canst not live ? <EOS>
I see , a better state to me belongs <EOS>
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was . <EOS>
Love is my sin , and thy dear virtue hate , <EOS>
And captive good attending captain ill . <EOS>
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving , <EOS>
In me thou seest the glowing of such fire , <EOS>
Than those old nine which rhymers invocate , <EOS>
Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere ; but in my sight , <EOS>
That having such a scope to show her pride , <EOS>
And therefore to your fair no painting set , <EOS>
For thy records , and what we see doth lie , <EOS>
For compound sweet ; forgoing simple savour , <EOS>
Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind , <EOS>
To give away your self , keeps your self still , <EOS>
And you and love are still my argument : <EOS>
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy : <EOS>
But why of two oaths ' breach do I accuse thee , <EOS>
Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye , <EOS>
( Though you do any thing ) he thinks no ill . <EOS>
To keep an adjunct to remember thee <EOS>
O know sweet love I always write of you , <EOS>
Both truth and beauty on my love depends : <EOS>
Beyond all date even to eternity . <EOS>
Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme , <EOS>
O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait , <EOS>
Save where you are , how happy you make those . <EOS>
Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste , <EOS>
And that thou teachest how to make one twain , <EOS>
That you are you , so dignifies his story . <EOS>
Upon the hours , and times of your desire ? <EOS>
Those lips that Love 's own hand did make , <EOS>
As testy sick men when their deaths be near , <EOS>
Have eyes to wonder , but lack tongues to praise . <EOS>
Yet this thy praise can not be so thy praise , <EOS>
In our two loves there is but one respect , <EOS>
The worth of that , is that which it contains , <EOS>
Now is the time that face should form another , <EOS>
Ay me , but yet thou mightst my seat forbear , <EOS>
Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee <EOS>
So dost thou too , and therein dignified : <EOS>
And night doth nightly make grief 's length seem stronger <EOS>
That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire , <EOS>
And all those friends which I thought buried . <EOS>
Spending again what is already spent : <EOS>
But since he died and poets better prove , <EOS>
And all in war with Time for love of you , <EOS>
And that in guess they measure by thy deeds , <EOS>
Lo thus by day my limbs , by night my mind , <EOS>
And whether that my angel be turned fiend , <EOS>
Serving with looks his sacred majesty , <EOS>
Why is my verse so barren of new pride ? <EOS>
And sable curls all silvered o'er with white : <EOS>
Hate of my sin , grounded on sinful loving , <EOS>
And by and by clean starved for a look , <EOS>
Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov'st those , <EOS>
Than think that we before have heard them told : <EOS>
On purpose laid to make the taker mad . <EOS>
Hang on such thorns , and play as wantonly , <EOS>
More flowers I noted , yet I none could see , <EOS>
None else to me , nor I to none alive , <EOS>
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood , <EOS>
Sweet love renew thy force , be it not said <EOS>
He robs thee of , and pays it thee again , <EOS>
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment . <EOS>
When summer 's breath their masked buds discloses : <EOS>
Then of thy beauty do I question make <EOS>
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame , <EOS>
And both for my sake lay on me this cross , <EOS>
And barren rage of death 's eternal cold ? <EOS>
Still losing when I saw my self to win ! <EOS>
Do I not think on thee when I forgot <EOS>
Let those who are in favour with their stars , <EOS>
As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st , <EOS>
Her eyes so suited , and they mourners seem , <EOS>
In process of the seasons have I seen , <EOS>
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat , <EOS>
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade , <EOS>
From his low tract and look another way : <EOS>
But do not so , I love thee in such sort , <EOS>
And grew a seeting bath which yet men prove , <EOS>
Therefore to give them from me was I bold , <EOS>
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage . <EOS>
For since each hand hath put on nature 's power , <EOS>
The one by toil , the other to complain <EOS>
As his triumphant prize , proud of this pride , <EOS>
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries : <EOS>
And every fair from fair sometime declines , <EOS>
And live no more to shame nor me , nor you . <EOS>
It is so grounded inward in my heart . <EOS>
That heals the wound , and cures not the disgrace : <EOS>
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan , <EOS>
Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war , <EOS>
How many a holy and obsequious tear <EOS>
Save breed to brave him , when he takes thee hence . <EOS>
Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange . <EOS>
And their gross painting might be better used , <EOS>
Against confounding age 's cruel knife , <EOS>
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept <EOS>
That music hath a far more pleasing sound : <EOS>
Incertainties now crown themselves assured , <EOS>
One of her feathered creatures broke away , <EOS>
Thee have I not locked up in any chest , <EOS>
In other accents do this praise confound <EOS>
And burn the long-lived phoenix , in her blood , <EOS>
Who plead for love , and look for recompense , <EOS>
Before a joy proposed behind a dream . <EOS>
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope , <EOS>
Kill me outright with looks , and rid my pain . <EOS>
O if ( I say ) you look upon this verse , <EOS>
And each doth good turns now unto the other , <EOS>
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep , <EOS>
Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within , <EOS>
Shall will in others seem right gracious , <EOS>
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest , <EOS>
Is poorly imitated after you , <EOS>
Unless thou take that honour from thy name : <EOS>
The canker blooms have full as deep a dye , <EOS>
Creating every bad a perfect best <EOS>
This told , I joy , but then no longer glad , <EOS>
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart , <EOS>
Love 's fire heats water , water cools not love . <EOS>
Making his style admired every where . <EOS>
How can I then be elder than thou art ? <EOS>
And gives thy pen both skill and argument . <EOS>
Suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her . <EOS>
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen , <EOS>
Shall Time 's best jewel from Time 's chest lie hid ? <EOS>
Before these bastard signs of fair were born , <EOS>
When thou thy self dost give invention light ? <EOS>
And under thee their poesy disperse . <EOS>
Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure , <EOS>
Hence , thou suborned informer , a true soul <EOS>
As I by yours , y'have passed a hell of time , <EOS>
The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age , <EOS>
My sinful earth these rebel powers array , <EOS>
For if you were by my unkindness shaken <EOS>
Reserve them for my love , not for their rhyme , <EOS>
For no man well of such a salve can speak , <EOS>
Makes black night beauteous , and her old face new . <EOS>
Kissing with golden face the meadows green ; <EOS>
All this the world well knows yet none knows well , <EOS>
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time . <EOS>
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly , <EOS>
Than unswept stone , besmeared with sluttish time . <EOS>
Where I may not remove nor be removed . <EOS>
Since my appeal says I did strive to prove <EOS>
So long as youth and thou are of one date , <EOS>
Where time and outward form would show it dead . <EOS>
Fair , kind , and true , varying to other words , <EOS>
For every vulgar paper to rehearse ? <EOS>
Which for memorial still with thee shall stay . <EOS>
Ay , fill it full with wills , and my will one , <EOS>
For she hath no exchequer now but his , <EOS>
Look what is best , that best I wish in thee , <EOS>
Who all their parts of me to thee did give , <EOS>
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape , and thine for me <EOS>
Are vanishing , or vanished out of sight , <EOS>
To side this title is impanelled <EOS>
Shall neigh ( no dull flesh ) in his fiery race , <EOS>
Root pity in thy heart that when it grows , <EOS>
But since your worth ( wide as the ocean is ) <EOS>
Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport , <EOS>
Thou usurer that put'st forth all to use , <EOS>
But love hate on for now I know thy mind , <EOS>
The wiry concord that mine ear confounds , <EOS>
For there can live no hatred in thine eye , <EOS>
Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe . <EOS>
Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time ? <EOS>
I grant I never saw a goddess go , <EOS>
By self-example mayst thou be denied . <EOS>
And nothing 'gainst Time 's scythe can make defence <EOS>
Thy beauty 's form in table of my heart , <EOS>
Sweets with sweets war not , joy delights in joy : <EOS>
But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing , <EOS>
Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green . <EOS>
Me for my dumb thoughts , speaking in effect . <EOS>
To thee I send this written embassage <EOS>
Is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide ? <EOS>
Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes . <EOS>
For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart <EOS>
And tongues to be , your being shall rehearse , <EOS>
So all their praises are but prophecies <EOS>
Then do thy office Muse , I teach thee how , <EOS>
But like a sad slave stay and think of nought <EOS>
Sweet thief , whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells , <EOS>
Which by and by black night doth take away , <EOS>
Shall you pace forth , your praise shall still find room , <EOS>
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought , <EOS>
If it be not , then love doth well denote , <EOS>
For that which longer nurseth the disease , <EOS>
Which but to-day by feeding is allayed , <EOS>
And given grace a double majesty . <EOS>
Let me not to the marriage of true minds <EOS>
This wish I have , then ten times happy me . <EOS>
Unlooked for joy in that I honour most ; <EOS>
Which steals men 's eyes and women 's souls amazeth . <EOS>
For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee : <EOS>
And haply of our old acquaintance tell . <EOS>
Within his bending sickle 's compass come , <EOS>
And art made tongue-tied by authority , <EOS>
Be thou the tenth Muse , ten times more in worth <EOS>
Or laid great bases for eternity , <EOS>
All mine was thine , before thou hadst this more : <EOS>
Since why to love , I can allege no cause . <EOS>
Never believe though in my nature reigned , <EOS>
If snow be white , why then her breasts are dun : <EOS>
Who is it that says most , which can say more , <EOS>
Thou art more lovely and more temperate : <EOS>
And play the mother 's part , kiss me , be kind . <EOS>
On Helen 's cheek all art of beauty set , <EOS>
But when your countenance filled up his line , <EOS>
Proving his beauty by succession thine . <EOS>
Accuse me thus , that I have scanted all , <EOS>
As any she belied with false compare . <EOS>
With beauty 's treasure ere it be self-killed : <EOS>
When proud-pied April ( dressed in all his trim ) <EOS>
The clear eye 's moiety , and the dear heart 's part . <EOS>
Richer than wealth , prouder than garments ' costs , <EOS>
Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing : <EOS>
Drawn after you , you pattern of all those . <EOS>
So till the judgment that your self arise , <EOS>
Had , having , and in quest , to have extreme , <EOS>
Will be a tattered weed of small worth held : <EOS>
That they behold and see not what they see ? <EOS>
As the death-bed , whereon it must expire , <EOS>
Let him but copy what in you is writ , <EOS>
And so of you , beauteous and lovely youth , <EOS>
And age in love , loves not to have years told . <EOS>
O let me true in love but truly write , <EOS>
Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays ? <EOS>
Who art as black as hell , as dark as night . <EOS>
I sick withal the help of bath desired , <EOS>
To make of monsters , and things indigest , <EOS>
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give ! <EOS>
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty 's field , <EOS>
Have added feathers to the learned 's wing , <EOS>
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still , <EOS>
And thence this slander as I think proceeds . <EOS>
So shall thou feed on death , that feeds on men , <EOS>
Leese but their show , their substance still lives sweet . <EOS>
How far I toil , still farther off from thee . <EOS>
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows <EOS>
Without thy help , by me be borne alone . <EOS>
Then lacked I matter , that enfeebled mine . <EOS>
The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge . <EOS>
That do not do the thing , they most do show , <EOS>
In me thou seest the twilight of such day , <EOS>
Where breath most breathes , even in the mouths of men . <EOS>
And precious phrase by all the Muses filed . <EOS>
Nay if thou lour'st on me do I not spend <EOS>
These vacant leaves thy mind 's imprint will bear , <EOS>
That Time will come and take my love away . <EOS>
Perforce am thine and all that is in me . <EOS>
As I not for my self , but for thee will , <EOS>
Self , so self-loving were iniquity . <EOS>
With April 's first-born flowers and all things rare , <EOS>
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse , <EOS>
A woman 's gentle heart but not acquainted <EOS>
Your self again after your self 's decease , <EOS>
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned , <EOS>
That due of many , now is thine alone . <EOS>
Thou art thy mother 's glass and she in thee <EOS>
That is so vexed with watching and with tears ? <EOS>
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee , <EOS>
At the wood 's boldness by thee blushing stand . <EOS>
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart , <EOS>
Happy to have thy love , happy to die ! <EOS>
I love to hear her speak , yet well I know , <EOS>
Be anchored in the bay where all men ride , <EOS>
Another time mine eye is my heart 's guest , <EOS>
And the sad augurs mock their own presage , <EOS>
And all things turns to fair , that eyes can see ! <EOS>
That it nor grows with heat , nor drowns with showers . <EOS>
Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap , <EOS>
Lo in the orient when the gracious light <EOS>
And on just proof surmise , accumulate , <EOS>
Doth follow night who like a fiend <EOS>
The owner 's tongue doth publish every where . <EOS>
The more I hear and see just cause of hate ? <EOS>
And yet to times in hope , my verse shall stand <EOS>
Of faults concealed , wherein I am attainted : <EOS>
But heaven in thy creation did decree , <EOS>
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place , <EOS>
So oft have I invoked thee for my muse , <EOS>
Let this sad interim like the ocean be <EOS>
They do but sweetly chide thee , who confounds <EOS>
You still shall live ( such virtue hath my pen ) <EOS>
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep <EOS>
I must each day say o'er the very same , <EOS>
Even so my sun one early morn did shine , <EOS>
So I , made lame by Fortune 's dearest spite <EOS>
But bears it out even to the edge of doom : <EOS>
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young , <EOS>
The fairest votary took up that fire , <EOS>
My name be buried where my body is , <EOS>
Thy beauty , and thy years full well befits , <EOS>
Stealing away the treasure of his spring : <EOS>
O 't is the first , 't is flattery in my seeing , <EOS>
Dulling my lines , and doing me disgrace . <EOS>
Why with the time do I not glance aside <EOS>
That then I scorn to change my state with kings . <EOS>
Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour , <EOS>
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent , <EOS>
O call not me to justify the wrong , <EOS>
Doing thee vantage , double-vantage me . <EOS>
Where beauty 's veil doth cover every blot , <EOS>
For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any <EOS>
Thou art as tyrannous , so as thou art , <EOS>
And your sweet semblance to some other give . <EOS>
Which parts the shore , where two contracted new , <EOS>
Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare , <EOS>
As to prevent our maladies unseen , <EOS>
And therefore have I slept in your report , <EOS>
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride , <EOS>
Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep , <EOS>
And in mine own love 's strength seem to decay , <EOS>
Though to it self , it only live and die , <EOS>
Have from the forests shook three summers ' pride , <EOS>
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned , <EOS>
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven : <EOS>
Mark how with my neglect I do dispense . <EOS>
Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you <EOS>
And from the forlorn world his visage hide <EOS>
Which like two spirits do suggest me still , <EOS>
Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate ' , <EOS>
beated and chopt with tanned antiquity , <EOS>
Hast thou the master mistress of my passion , <EOS>
Or bends with the remover to remove . <EOS>
But when she saw my woeful state , <EOS>
And worse essays proved thee my best of love . <EOS>
Which in their wills count bad what I think good ? <EOS>
In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds , <EOS>
And in our faults by lies we flattered be . <EOS>
Being fond on praise , which makes your praises worse . <EOS>
Not marble , nor the gilded monuments <EOS>
And thou in this shalt find thy monument , <EOS>
My love is as a fever longing still , <EOS>
And threescore year would make the world away : <EOS>
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay , <EOS>
Against thy reasons making no defence . <EOS>
Whose worth 's unknown , although his height be taken . <EOS>
Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope , <EOS>
Art left the prey of every vulgar thief . <EOS>
He learned but surety-like to write for me , <EOS>
O for my sake do you with Fortune chide , <EOS>
And gilded honour shamefully misplaced , <EOS>
'I hate ' she altered with an end , <EOS>
Thou dost beguile the world , unbless some mother . <EOS>
More than that tongue that more hath more expressed . <EOS>
And they shall live , and he in them still green . <EOS>
Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day , <EOS>
Is from the book of honour razed quite , <EOS>
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines , <EOS>
The constancy and virtue of your love . <EOS>
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies , <EOS>
So thy great gift upon misprision growing , <EOS>
And let that pine to aggravate thy store ; <EOS>
Now with the drops of this most balmy time , <EOS>
Within be fed , without be rich no more , <EOS>
Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long , <EOS>
To hear with eyes belongs to love 's fine wit . <EOS>
And stretched metre of an antique song . <EOS>
This thought is as a death which can not choose <EOS>
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before ? <EOS>
And the just pleasure lost , which is so deemed , <EOS>
Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled , <EOS>
That looks on tempests and is never shaken ; <EOS>
So am I as the rich whose blessed key , <EOS>
When that mine eye is famished for a look , <EOS>
No love , my love , that thou mayst true love call , <EOS>
Whilst like a willing patient I will drink , <EOS>
And make time 's spoils despised everywhere . <EOS>
Speak of my lameness , and I straight will halt : <EOS>
Some in their hawks and hounds , some in their horse . <EOS>
By wilful taste of what thy self refusest . <EOS>
Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days , <EOS>
Uttering bare truth , even so as foes commend . <EOS>
And truly not the morning sun of heaven <EOS>
Thy hungry eyes , even till they wink with fulness , <EOS>
My spirit is thine the better part of me , <EOS>
The humble salve , which wounded bosoms fits ! <EOS>
Thine eyes I love , and they as pitying me , <EOS>
But these particulars are not my measure , <EOS>
And of this book , this learning mayst thou taste . <EOS>
Wherein I should your great deserts repay , <EOS>
But my five wits , nor my five senses can <EOS>
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain <EOS>
When day 's oppression is not eased by night , <EOS>
Still constant in a wondrous excellence , <EOS>
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee : <EOS>
Not making worse what nature made so clear , <EOS>
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live , <EOS>
To give full growth to that which still doth grow . <EOS>
To set a form upon desired change , <EOS>
Be wise as thou art cruel , do not press <EOS>
And yet this time removed was summer 's time , <EOS>
O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem , <EOS>
So that my self bring water for my stain , <EOS>
I found ( or thought I found ) you did exceed , <EOS>
And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye , <EOS>
That I in thy abundance am sufficed , <EOS>
I love not less , though less the show appear , <EOS>
Do in consent shake hands to torture me , <EOS>
That you were once unkind befriends me now , <EOS>
And summer 's lease hath all too short a date : <EOS>
The beast that bears me , tired with my woe , <EOS>
O me ! what eyes hath love put in my head , <EOS>
Then being asked , where all thy beauty lies , <EOS>
Since from thee going , he went wilful-slow , <EOS>
Till then , not show my head where thou mayst prove me . <EOS>
But then my friend 's heart let my poor heart bail , <EOS>
To speak of that which gives thee all thy might ? <EOS>
So love be thou , although to-day thou fill <EOS>
Fairing the foul with art 's false borrowed face , <EOS>
Whose strength 's abundance weakens his own heart ; <EOS>
Lifts up his burning head , each under eye <EOS>
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd <EOS>
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves , <EOS>
Fair , kind , and true , is all my argument , <EOS>
Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds , <EOS>
And yet by heaven I think my love as rare , <EOS>
Attending on his golden pilgrimage : <EOS>
I grant thou wert not married to my muse , <EOS>
Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell <EOS>
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine <EOS>
Save that my soul 's imaginary sight <EOS>
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth , <EOS>
To bear greater wrong , than hate 's known injury . <EOS>
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill , <EOS>
That to his subject lends not some small glory , <EOS>
The ills that were not , grew to faults assured , <EOS>
Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light ? <EOS>
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit , <EOS>
But then begins a journey in my head <EOS>
That millions of strange shadows on you tend ? <EOS>
Let no unkind , no fair beseechers kill , <EOS>
O but with mine , compare thou thine own state , <EOS>
For slander 's mark was ever yet the fair , <EOS>
And only herald to the gaudy spring , <EOS>
Let me confess that we two must be twain , <EOS>
Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name . <EOS>
A quest of thoughts , all tenants to the heart , <EOS>
Might I not then say 'Now I love you best , ' <EOS>
For thou betraying me , I do betray <EOS>
But you like none , none you for constant heart . <EOS>
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense , <EOS>
And losing her , my friend hath found that loss , <EOS>
And when a woman woos , what woman 's son , <EOS>
May make seem bare , in wanting words to show it ; <EOS>
I send them back again and straight grow sad . <EOS>
The sea all water , yet receives rain still , <EOS>
Against this coming end you should prepare , <EOS>
Now counting best to be with you alone , <EOS>
Above a mortal pitch , that struck me dead ? <EOS>
As after sunset fadeth in the west , <EOS>
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie , <EOS>
With my love 's picture then my eye doth feast , <EOS>
Then soul live thou upon thy servant 's loss , <EOS>
In sequent toil all forwards do contend . <EOS>
Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit , <EOS>
Our love was new , and then but in the spring , <EOS>
And therefore from my face she turns my foes , <EOS>
Ah wherefore with infection should he live , <EOS>
Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly , <EOS>
Past reason hunted , and no sooner had <EOS>
Nor tender feeling to base touches prone , <EOS>
O that record could with a backward look , <EOS>
And he that calls on thee , let him bring forth <EOS>
Then in the blazon of sweet beauty 's best , <EOS>
But thou wilt not , nor he will not be free , <EOS>
Mad in pursuit and in possession so , <EOS>
As interest of the dead , which now appear , <EOS>
And I will comment upon that offence , <EOS>
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind . <EOS>
Whose influence is thine , and born of thee , <EOS>
Beauty no pencil , beauty 's truth to lay : <EOS>
I think good thoughts , whilst other write good words , <EOS>
Why should my heart think that a several plot , <EOS>
The little Love-god lying once asleep , <EOS>
Since seldom coming in that long year set , <EOS>
I tell the day to please him thou art bright , <EOS>
From fairest creatures we desire increase , <EOS>
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay , <EOS>
And so the general of hot desire , <EOS>
So that eternal love in love 's fresh case , <EOS>
That she might think me some untutored youth , <EOS>
But why thy odour matcheth not thy show , <EOS>
Yet this abundant issue seemed to me <EOS>
Some glory in their birth , some in their skill , <EOS>
With insufficiency my heart to sway , <EOS>
When all the breathers of this world are dead , <EOS>
Those hours that with gentle work did frame <EOS>
Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue , <EOS>
The rose looks fair , but fairer we it deem <EOS>
For whether beauty , birth , or wealth , or wit , <EOS>
Why write I still all one , ever the same , <EOS>
To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me . <EOS>
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot , <EOS>
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage , <EOS>
Robbed others ' beds ' revenues of their rents . <EOS>
For such a time do I now fortify <EOS>
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured , <EOS>
Find no determination , then you were <EOS>
'Will ' , will fulfil the treasure of thy love , <EOS>
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay ? <EOS>
The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature , <EOS>
How many gazers mightst thou lead away , <EOS>
He nor that affable familiar ghost <EOS>
When every private widow well may keep , <EOS>
The eyes ( fore duteous ) now converted are <EOS>
Making a couplement of proud compare <EOS>
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace : <EOS>
Then if he thrive and I be cast away , <EOS>
When I behold the violet past prime , <EOS>
Both find each other , and I lose both twain , <EOS>
Desiring this man 's art , and that man 's scope , <EOS>
For precious friends hid in death 's dateless night , <EOS>
Thou mak'st faults graces , that to thee resort : <EOS>
And I my self am mortgaged to thy will , <EOS>
Within the gentle closure of my breast , <EOS>
If all were minded so , the times should cease , <EOS>
Against the stormy gusts of winter 's day <EOS>
Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain . <EOS>
And to the most of praise add something more , <EOS>
O let my looks be then the eloquence , <EOS>
The worst was this , my love was my decay . <EOS>
That is so proud thy service to despise , <EOS>
Be scorned , like old men of less truth than tongue , <EOS>
My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer , <EOS>
No marvel then though I mistake my view , <EOS>
You should live twice in it , and in my rhyme . <EOS>
And so should you , to love things nothing worth . <EOS>
Which in thy breast doth live , as thine in me , <EOS>
When wasteful war shall statues overturn , <EOS>
Or you survive when I in earth am rotten , <EOS>
Was used in giving gentle doom : <EOS>
She may detain , but not still keep her treasure ! <EOS>
In one of thine , from that which thou departest , <EOS>
I never saw that you did painting need , <EOS>
But since she pricked thee out for women 's pleasure , <EOS>
Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed ? <EOS>
But if thou live remembered not to be , <EOS>
When I perceive that men as plants increase , <EOS>
Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true , <EOS>
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue , <EOS>
Lest I ( too much profane ) should do it wronk : <EOS>
The basest jewel will be well esteemed : <EOS>
Slandering creation with a false esteem , <EOS>
If there be nothing new , but that which is , <EOS>
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May , <EOS>
Or I shall live your epitaph to make , <EOS>
Upon the farthest earth removed from thee , <EOS>
Which hides your life , and shows not half your parts : <EOS>
To swear against the truth so foul a be . <EOS>
This were to be new made when thou art old , <EOS>
And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me . <EOS>
That censures falsely what they see aright ? <EOS>
Some in their garments though new-fangled ill : <EOS>
So do our minutes hasten to their end , <EOS>
To find out shames and idle hours in me , <EOS>
And for they looked but with divining eyes , <EOS>
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries , <EOS>
But that I hope some good conceit of thine <EOS>
Vaunt in their youthful sap , at height decrease , <EOS>
Or at your hand th ' account of hours to crave , <EOS>
Of my dull bearer , when from thee I speed , <EOS>
Even that your pity is enough to cure me . <EOS>
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee , <EOS>
And in the praise thereof spends all his might , <EOS>
Nay if you read this line , remember not , <EOS>
Describe Adonis and the counterfeit , <EOS>
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view , <EOS>
For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate . <EOS>
( A closet never pierced with crystal eyes ) <EOS>
Authorizing thy trespass with compare , <EOS>
Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend <EOS>
Then how when nature calls thee to be gone , <EOS>
Then hate me when thou wilt , if ever , now , <EOS>
As fast as objects to his beams assemble : <EOS>
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue , <EOS>
Counting no old thing old , thou mine , I thine , <EOS>
That all the world besides methinks are dead . <EOS>
Wooing his purity with her foul pride . <EOS>
Of thee , thy record never can be missed : <EOS>
Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits , <EOS>
And in this change is my invention spent , <EOS>
And patience tame to sufferance bide each check , <EOS>
And almost thence my nature is subdued <EOS>
Nor my beloved as an idol show , <EOS>
Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took , <EOS>
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart , <EOS>
To make some special instant special-blest , <EOS>
For where is she so fair whose uneared womb <EOS>
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan ; <EOS>
Than niggard truth would willingly impart : <EOS>
( Making lascivious comments on thy sport ) <EOS>
And keep invention in a noted weed , <EOS>
In winged speed no motion shall I know , <EOS>
To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace , <EOS>
Upon thy part I can set down a story <EOS>
Then can I drown an eye ( unused to flow ) <EOS>
That love is merchandized , whose rich esteeming , <EOS>
And thou present'st a pure unstained prime . <EOS>
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight , <EOS>
That thereby beauty 's rose might never die , <EOS>
And that unfair which fairly doth excel : <EOS>
And with his presence grace impiety , <EOS>
And for my self mine own worth do define , <EOS>
The first my thought , the other my desire , <EOS>
When all my best doth worship thy defect , <EOS>
That thou hast her it is not all my grief , <EOS>
How can my muse want subject to invent <EOS>
To him that bears the strong offence 's cross . <EOS>
To truths translated , and for true things deemed . <EOS>
To the clear day with thy much clearer light , <EOS>
On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon , <EOS>
Return forgetful Muse , and straight redeem , <EOS>
O never say that I was false of heart , <EOS>
And found such fair assistance in my verse , <EOS>
Thy self thy foe , to thy sweet self too cruel : <EOS>
To me that languished for her sake : <EOS>
So thou , thy self out-going in thy noon : <EOS>
Which used lives th ' executor to be . <EOS>
Th ' expense of spirit in a waste of shame <EOS>
When I do count the clock that tells the time , <EOS>
What can mine own praise to mine own self bring : <EOS>
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay ! <EOS>
Her audit ( though delayed ) answered must be , <EOS>
The prey of worms , my body being dead , <EOS>
As high as learning , my rude ignorance . <EOS>
That to my use it might unused stay <EOS>
But what 's so blessed-fair that fears no blot ? <EOS>
And chide thy beauty , and thy straying youth , <EOS>
Him have I lost , thou hast both him and me , <EOS>
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme ? <EOS>
For that same groan doth put this in my mind , <EOS>
So your sweet hue , which methinks still doth stand <EOS>
Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars <EOS>
Drink up the monarch 's plague this flattery ? <EOS>
From you have I been absent in the spring , <EOS>
Thus policy in love t ' anticipate <EOS>
In whose confine immured is the store , <EOS>
Past reason hated as a swallowed bait , <EOS>
My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue . <EOS>
Let not my love be called idolatry , <EOS>
Whose speechless song being many , seeming one , <EOS>
'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend . ' <EOS>
Eternal numbers to outlive long date . <EOS>
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem , <EOS>
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore , <EOS>
And therefore art enforced to seek anew , <EOS>
Your name from hence immortal life shall have , <EOS>
Great princes ' favourites their fair leaves spread , <EOS>
Being had to triumph , being lacked to hope . <EOS>
On your broad main doth wilfully appear . <EOS>
From hence your memory death can not take , <EOS>
That beauty still may live in thine or thee . <EOS>
A vengeful canker eat him up to death . <EOS>
And to this false plague are they now transferred . <EOS>
Our dates are brief , and therefore we admire , <EOS>
For at a frown they in their glory die . <EOS>
Save that to die , I leave my love alone . <EOS>
Thou mayst be false , and yet I know it not . <EOS>
Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe , <EOS>
And summer 's green all girded up in sheaves <EOS>
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet , <EOS>
An eye more bright than theirs , less false in rolling : <EOS>
Not wond'ring at the present , nor the past , <EOS>
Die single and thine image dies with thee . <EOS>
The argument all bare is of more worth <EOS>
Upon thy self thy beauty 's legacy ? <EOS>
But now is black beauty 's successive heir , <EOS>
So thou be good , slander doth but approve , <EOS>
If the dull substance of my flesh were thought , <EOS>
Or say with princes if it shall go well <EOS>
The very part was consecrate to thee , <EOS>
As if by some instinct the wretch did know <EOS>
Weighs not the dust and injury of age , <EOS>
Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain , <EOS>
These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover : <EOS>
Even those that said I could not love you dearer , <EOS>
Thy looks should nothing thence , but sweetness tell . <EOS>
Excuse not silence so , for't lies in thee , <EOS>
And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding : <EOS>
And kept unused the user so destroys it : <EOS>
But do thy worst to steal thy self away , <EOS>
But being both from me both to each friend , <EOS>
Or call it winter , which being full of care , <EOS>
For who 's so dumb that can not write to thee , <EOS>
Therefore in that I can not know thy change , <EOS>
As soon as think the place where he would be . <EOS>
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds : <EOS>
If I might teach thee wit better it were , <EOS>
Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase , <EOS>
But at my mistress ' eye Love 's brand new-fired , <EOS>
But when I sleep , in dreams they look on thee , <EOS>
Time 's thievish progress to eternity . <EOS>
Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear , <EOS>
They rightly do inherit heaven 's graces , <EOS>
Then if for my love , thou my love receivest , <EOS>
If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide , <EOS>
When others would give life , and bring a tomb . <EOS>
Her love , for whose dear love I rise and fall . <EOS>
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell , <EOS>
Devouring Time blunt thou the lion 's paws , <EOS>
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face , <EOS>
In vowing new hate after new love bearing : <EOS>
Exceeded by the height of happier men . <EOS>
Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid , <EOS>
That 's for thy self to breed another thee , <EOS>
Whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never ! <EOS>
Whether we are mended , or whether better they , <EOS>
Book both my wilfulness and errors down , <EOS>
Without accusing you of injury . <EOS>
Their images I loved , I view in thee , <EOS>
Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside , <EOS>
The manner of my pity-wanting pain . <EOS>
Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love 's delight . <EOS>
O what excuse will my poor beast then find , <EOS>
One thing expressing , leaves out difference . <EOS>
In all external grace you have some part , <EOS>
For still temptation follows where thou art . <EOS>
That mine eye loves it and doth first begin . <EOS>
A god in love , to whom I am confined . <EOS>
Though thou repent , yet I have still the loss , <EOS>
Yet do not so , but since I am near slain , <EOS>
That she hath thee is of my wailing chief , <EOS>
Now all is done , have what shall have no end , <EOS>
Thy edge should blunter be than appetite , <EOS>
Wherein it finds a joy above the rest , <EOS>
Take heed ( dear heart ) of this large privilege , <EOS>
Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone , <EOS>
'T is better to be vile than vile esteemed , <EOS>
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime , <EOS>
If thy unworthiness raised love in me , <EOS>
What freezings have I felt , what dark days seen ! <EOS>
Who even but now come back again assured , <EOS>
Dost hold Time 's fickle glass his fickle hour : <EOS>
To eat the world 's due , by the grave and thee . <EOS>
But wherefore do not you a mightier way <EOS>
Though I ( once gone ) to all the world must die , <EOS>
Because I would not dull you with my song . <EOS>
I do believe her though I know she lies , <EOS>
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill . <EOS>
Shall profit thee , and much enrich thy book . <EOS>
Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss , <EOS>
O what a happy title do I find , <EOS>
For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight , <EOS>
My heart , mine eye the freedom of that right , <EOS>
Sings this to thee , 'Thou single wilt prove none ' . <EOS>
To be diseased ere that there was true needing . <EOS>
To follow that which flies before her face : <EOS>
Featured like him , like him with friends possessed , <EOS>
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate <EOS>
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide , <EOS>
Forgot upon your dearest love to call , <EOS>
My glass shall not persuade me I am old , <EOS>
And thither hied a sad distempered guest . <EOS>
If this be error and upon me proved , <EOS>
Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read , <EOS>
Which my heart knows the wide world 's common place ? <EOS>
That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone : <EOS>
Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again . <EOS>
If thinking on me then should make you woe . <EOS>
At random from the truth vainly expressed . <EOS>
And more , much more than in my verse can sit , <EOS>
That I may not be so , nor thou belied , <EOS>
I summon up remembrance of things past , <EOS>
And do so love , yet when they have devised , <EOS>
Made old offences of affections new . <EOS>
Thy end is truth 's and beauty 's doom and date . <EOS>
O sure I am the wits of former days , <EOS>
Thy love is better than high birth to me , <EOS>
My sweet love 's beauty , though my lover 's life . <EOS>
That I have hoisted sail to all the winds <EOS>
Although I swear it to my self alone . <EOS>
Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy ? <EOS>
Was it his spirit , by spirits taught to write , <EOS>
For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move , <EOS>
The ornament of beauty is suspect , <EOS>
Which heavily he answers with a groan , <EOS>
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love ? <EOS>
Come daily to the banks , that when they see : <EOS>
Yet him for this , my love no whit disdaineth , <EOS>
The better angel is a man right fair : <EOS>
These offices , so oft as thou wilt look , <EOS>
Think all but one , and me in that one 'Will . ' <EOS>
As thou being mine , mine is thy good report . <EOS>
No ! Time , thou shalt not boast that I do change , <EOS>
And in my will no fair acceptance shine ? <EOS>
If thou survive my well-contented day , <EOS>
Were't aught to me I bore the canopy , <EOS>
As thou being mine , mine is thy good report . <EOS>
At my abuses , reckon up their own , <EOS>
Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat , <EOS>
Yet be most proud of that which I compile , <EOS>
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee , <EOS>
And you but one , can every shadow lend : <EOS>
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes : <EOS>
If thou turn back and my loud crying still . <EOS>
Pointing to each his thunder , rain and wind , <EOS>
In a cold valley-fountain of that ground : <EOS>
Th ' uncertain sickly appetite to please : <EOS>
Thy lovers withering , as thy sweet self grow'st . <EOS>
You had a father , let your son say so . <EOS>
How would ( I say ) mine eyes be blessed made , <EOS>
Two loves I have of comfort and despair , <EOS>
Bring me within the level of your frown , <EOS>
My reason the physician to my love , <EOS>
Without all ornament , it self and true , <EOS>
And thou away , the very birds are mute . <EOS>
To put fair truth upon so foul a face ? <EOS>
But 't is my heart that loves what they despise , <EOS>
Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken , <EOS>
In gentle numbers time so idly spent , <EOS>
That by this separation I may give : <EOS>
All men are bad and in their badness reign . <EOS>
Of him , my self , and thee I am forsaken , <EOS>
So shall those blots that do with me remain , <EOS>
Fair , kind , and true , have often lived alone . <EOS>
Lord of my love , to whom in vassalage <EOS>
The pain be mine , but thine shall be the praise . <EOS>
In others ' works thou dost but mend the style , <EOS>
That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect , <EOS>
Give them thy fingers , me thy lips to kiss . <EOS>
And taught it thus anew to greet : <EOS>
By new unfolding his imprisoned pride . <EOS>
Or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove , <EOS>
One blushing shame , another white despair : <EOS>
Against that time do I ensconce me here <EOS>
O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought , <EOS>
And for that sorrow , which I then did feel , <EOS>
The hand that writ it , for I love you so , <EOS>
All tongues ( the voice of souls ) give thee that due , <EOS>
And the firm soil win of the watery main , <EOS>
And death once dead , there 's no more dying then . <EOS>
He is contented thy poor drudge to be , <EOS>
Tired with all these for restful death I cry , <EOS>
So then I am not lame , poor , nor despised , <EOS>
But yet be blamed , if thou thy self deceivest <EOS>
But do not so , I love thee in such sort , <EOS>
Revenge upon my self with present moan ? <EOS>
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see , <EOS>
As those two mourning eyes become thy face : <EOS>
To hideous winter and confounds him there , <EOS>
But thou , to whom my jewels trifles are , <EOS>
From thee , the pleasure of the fleeting year ! <EOS>
In praise of ladies dead , and lovely knights , <EOS>
When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum , <EOS>
All days are nights to see till I see thee , <EOS>
How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted <EOS>
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide , <EOS>
I all alone beweep my outcast state , <EOS>
From hands of falsehood , in sure wards of trust ! <EOS>
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold , <EOS>
But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me : <EOS>
But ah , thought kills me that I am not thought <EOS>
Thy adverse party is thy advocate , <EOS>
Doth part his function , and is partly blind , <EOS>
But now my gracious numbers are decayed , <EOS>
They that have power to hurt , and will do none , <EOS>
Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand , <EOS>
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure , <EOS>
Thy pyramids built up with newer might <EOS>
To leave poor me , thou hast the strength of laws , <EOS>
Is't not enough to torture me alone , <EOS>
So should the lines of life that life repair <EOS>
And all my honest faith in thee is lost . <EOS>
But mutual render , only me for thee . <EOS>
And yet methinks I have astronomy , <EOS>
Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight , <EOS>
Not mine own fears , nor the prophetic soul , <EOS>
But no such roses see I in her cheeks , <EOS>
Unless this general evil they maintain , <EOS>
Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure , <EOS>
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell . <EOS>
Mine ransoms yours , and yours must ransom me . <EOS>
Three themes in one , which wondrous scope affords . <EOS>
Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken , <EOS>
For nothing hold me , so it please thee hold , <EOS>
No want of conscience hold it that I call , <EOS>
Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight , <EOS>
And beauty slandered with a bastard shame , <EOS>
As the perfumed tincture of the roses , <EOS>
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea , <EOS>
They look into the beauty of thy mind , <EOS>
I see their antique pen would have expressed , <EOS>
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer , <EOS>
Thou dost love her , because thou know'st I love her , <EOS>
But for his theft in pride of all his growth <EOS>
Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured . <EOS>
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me ; <EOS>
I will not praise that purpose not to sell . <EOS>
Such seems your beauty still : three winters cold , <EOS>
As I 'll my self disgrace , knowing thy will , <EOS>
So all my best is dressing old words new , <EOS>
Ah do not , when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow , <EOS>
But here 's the joy , my friend and I are one , <EOS>
Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter , <EOS>
( Like to the lark at break of day arising <EOS>
And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill , <EOS>
For never-resting time leads summer on <EOS>
It might for Fortune 's bastard be unfathered , <EOS>
Till each to razed oblivion yield his part <EOS>
Than this rich praise , that you alone , are you ? <EOS>
Mark how one string sweet husband to another , <EOS>
How can it ? O how can love 's eye be true , <EOS>
Of different flowers in odour and in hue , <EOS>
Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing , <EOS>
Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn , <EOS>
In things right true my heart and eyes have erred , <EOS>
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell <EOS>
My mistress when she walks treads on the ground . <EOS>
To subjects worse have given admiring praise . <EOS>
A maid of Dian 's this advantage found , <EOS>
For as you were when first your eye I eyed , <EOS>
And die as fast as they see others grow , <EOS>
O fearful meditation , where alack , <EOS>
If some suspect of ill masked not thy show , <EOS>
To win me soon to hell my female evil , <EOS>
Injurious distance should not stop my way , <EOS>
Then in the number let me pass untold , <EOS>
To stand in thy affairs , fall by thy side . <EOS>
Sometime all full with feasting on your sight , <EOS>
No love toward others in that bosom sits <EOS>
O none but unthrifts , dear my love you know , <EOS>
But in the onset come , so shall I taste <EOS>
For nimble thought can jump both sea and land , <EOS>
Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch <EOS>
Askance and strangely : but by all above , <EOS>
For it no form delivers to the heart <EOS>
O therefore love be of thyself so wary , <EOS>
Of their sweet deaths , are sweetest odours made : <EOS>
After my death ( dear love ) forget me quite , <EOS>
In him those holy antique hours are seen , <EOS>
Save what is had , or must from you be took . <EOS>
When most impeached , stands least in thy control . <EOS>
With lines and wrinkles , when his youthful morn <EOS>
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will ' , <EOS>
That barren tender of a poet 's debt : <EOS>
Or captain jewels in the carcanet . <EOS>
If Nature ( sovereign mistress over wrack ) <EOS>
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st , <EOS>
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass , <EOS>
And weep afresh love 's long since cancelled woe , <EOS>
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid ? <EOS>
Hearing you praised , I say 't is so , 't is true , <EOS>
In days long since , before these last so bad . <EOS>
What old December 's bareness everywhere ! <EOS>
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up , <EOS>
When that shall vade , by verse distills your truth . <EOS>
His rider loved not speed being made from thee : <EOS>
Or else of thee this I prognosticate , <EOS>
Whoever hath her wish , thou hast thy will , <EOS>
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore , <EOS>
Beauteous thou art , therefore to be assailed . <EOS>
Who for thy self art so unprovident . <EOS>
And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure , <EOS>
O carve not with thy hours my love 's fair brow , <EOS>
Unmoved , cold , and to temptation slow : <EOS>
And proud of many , lives upon his gains ? <EOS>
Before the golden tresses of the dead , <EOS>
More than enough am I that vex thee still , <EOS>
Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend , <EOS>
And with old woes new wail my dear time 's waste : <EOS>
To what you will , to you it doth belong , <EOS>
Giving him aid , my verse astonished . <EOS>
So him I lose through my unkind abuse . <EOS>
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth <EOS>
Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse , <EOS>
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish : <EOS>
Straight in her heart did mercy come , <EOS>
With mine own weakness being best acquainted , <EOS>
Within thine own bud buriest thy content , <EOS>
That it could so preposterously be stained , <EOS>
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel ; <EOS>
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour , <EOS>
Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower , <EOS>
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel . <EOS>
To tie up envy , evermore enlarged , <EOS>
All men make faults , and even I in this , <EOS>
For to no other pass my verses tend , <EOS>
How can I then return in happy plight <EOS>
And perspective it is best painter 's art . <EOS>
But when my glass shows me my self indeed <EOS>
The perfect ceremony of love 's rite , <EOS>
Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch : <EOS>
And all they foul that thy complexion lack . <EOS>
Not that the summer is less pleasant now <EOS>
And all those beauties whereof now he 's king <EOS>
The which he will not every hour survey , <EOS>
O none , unless this miracle have might , <EOS>
Theirs for their style I 'll read , his for his love ' . <EOS>
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show , <EOS>
My verse alone had all thy gentle grace , <EOS>
Then look I death my days should expiate . <EOS>
That in black ink my love may still shine bright . <EOS>
To new-found methods , and to compounds strange ? <EOS>
In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn , <EOS>
Let those whom nature hath not made for store , <EOS>
When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so ! <EOS>
For why should others ' false adulterate eyes <EOS>
And in fresh numbers number all your graces , <EOS>
Points on me graciously with fair aspect , <EOS>
Not prizing her poor infant 's discontent ; <EOS>
Mine be thy love and thy love 's use their treasure . <EOS>
The bloody spur can not provoke him on , <EOS>
I never writ , nor no man ever loved . <EOS>
This I do vow and this shall ever be , <EOS>
Bound for the prize of ( all too precious ) you , <EOS>
And constant stars in them I read such art <EOS>
And lace it self with his society ? <EOS>
From limits far remote , where thou dost stay , <EOS>
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie , <EOS>
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence , <EOS>
Although in me each part will be forgotten . <EOS>
But that wild music burthens every bough , <EOS>
That better is , by evil still made better . <EOS>
To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding ; <EOS>
That tongue that tells the story of thy days , <EOS>
Much liker than your painted counterfeit : <EOS>
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse , <EOS>
'T is thee ( my self ) that for my self I praise , <EOS>
And so my patent back again is swerving . <EOS>
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought , <EOS>
Harsh , featureless , and rude , barrenly perish : <EOS>
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast , <EOS>
Suspect I may , yet not directly tell , <EOS>
Look what thy memory can not contain , <EOS>
To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell . <EOS>
Showing their birth , and where they did proceed ? <EOS>
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted , <EOS>
Bear thine eyes straight , though thy proud heart go wide . <EOS>
Worthy perusal stand against thy sight , <EOS>
But the defendant doth that plea deny , <EOS>
That god forbid , that made me first your slave , <EOS>
When I break twenty ? I am perjured most , <EOS>
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st , <EOS>
Until life 's composition be recured , <EOS>
And brought to medicine a healthful state <EOS>
And often is his gold complexion dimmed , <EOS>
As thus , mine eye 's due is thy outward part , <EOS>
Without this folly , age , and cold decay , <EOS>
That he shall never cut from memory <EOS>
Most true it is , that I have looked on truth <EOS>
For I have sworn thee fair : more perjured I , <EOS>
Then will I swear beauty herself is black , <EOS>
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes , <EOS>
Of their fair subject , blessing every book . <EOS>
My life being made of four , with two alone , <EOS>
And to be sure that is not false I swear , <EOS>
And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen , <EOS>
Leaving thee living in posterity ? <EOS>
My tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still , <EOS>
What means the world to say it is not so ? <EOS>
Of the wide world , dreaming on things to come , <EOS>
My life hath in this line some interest , <EOS>
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew : <EOS>
Your self to pardon of self-doing crime . <EOS>
Or me to whom thou gav'st it , else mistaking , <EOS>
Thou truly fair , wert truly sympathized , <EOS>
Robbing no old to dress his beauty new , <EOS>
Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be . <EOS>
This brand she quenched in a cool well by , <EOS>
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride , <EOS>
For then my thoughts ( from far where I abide ) <EOS>
When thou shalt be disposed to set me light , <EOS>
Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins , <EOS>
That nothing me , a something sweet to thee . <EOS>
When not to be , receives reproach of being , <EOS>
Th ' imprisoned absence of your liberty , <EOS>
Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man , <EOS>
Plods dully on , to bear that weight in me , <EOS>
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied ? <EOS>
Thus far for love , my love-suit sweet fulfil . <EOS>
How would thy shadow 's form , form happy show , <EOS>
That I might see what the old world could say , <EOS>
While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes . <EOS>
Then should I spur though mounted on the wind , <EOS>
For they in thee a thousand errors note , <EOS>
So is it not with me as with that muse , <EOS>
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest , <EOS>
And this my hand , against my self uprear , <EOS>
He pays the whole , and yet am I not free . <EOS>
They know what beauty is , see where it lies , <EOS>
When I shall see thee frown on my defects , <EOS>
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace , <EOS>
Are windows to my breast , where-through the sun <EOS>
Yet this shall I ne'er know but live in doubt , <EOS>
If my slight muse do please these curious days , <EOS>
For if I should despair I should grow mad , <EOS>
Yet what the best is , take the worst to be . <EOS>
They draw but what they see , know not the heart . <EOS>
But if that flower with base infection meet , <EOS>
How like Eve 's apple doth thy beauty grow , <EOS>
And in my madness might speak ill of thee , <EOS>
Of public honour and proud titles boast , <EOS>
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed : <EOS>
Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap , <EOS>
But you shall shine more bright in these contents <EOS>
Therefore I lie with her , and she with me , <EOS>
If from thy self , to store thou wouldst convert : <EOS>
Compared with loss of thee , will not seem so . <EOS>
Mine own self-love quite contrary I read : <EOS>
That wear this world out to the ending doom . <EOS>
Then thank him not for that which he doth say , <EOS>
Of bird , of flower , or shape which it doth latch , <EOS>
Which have no correspondence with true sight , <EOS>
Were an all-eating shame , and thriftless praise . <EOS>
The summer 's flower is to the summer sweet , <EOS>
Since mind at first in character was done . <EOS>
Without all bail shall carry me away , <EOS>
Save where thou art not , though I feel thou art , <EOS>
The crow , or dove , it shapes them to your feature . <EOS>
Tired with all these , from these would I be gone , <EOS>
To live a second life on second head , <EOS>
Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove . <EOS>
O thou my lovely boy who in thy power , <EOS>
And do whate'er thou wilt swift-footed Time <EOS>
I can not blame thee , for my love thou usest , <EOS>
While thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse , <EOS>
Shall sum my count , and make my old excuse ' <EOS>
Shall I compare thee to a summer 's day ? <EOS>
Where wasteful time debateth with decay <EOS>
With Time 's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn , <EOS>
O let it then as well beseem thy heart <EOS>
So flatter I the swart-complexioned night , <EOS>
Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck , <EOS>
To see his active child do deeds of youth , <EOS>
Those children nursed , delivered from thy brain , <EOS>
The world will be thy widow and still weep , <EOS>
When most I wink then do mine eyes best see , <EOS>
Where you may be , or your affairs suppose , <EOS>
Now stand you on the top of happy hours , <EOS>
And peace proclaims olives of endless age . <EOS>
When in the least of them my life hath end , <EOS>
When sometime lofty towers I see down-rased , <EOS>
That you your self being extant well might show , <EOS>
Th ' offender 's sorrow lends but weak relief <EOS>
And your true rights be termed a poet 's rage , <EOS>
O let me suffer ( being at your beck ) <EOS>
To love that well , which thou must leave ere long . <EOS>
That thou consum'st thy self in single life ? <EOS>
By oft predict that I in heaven find . <EOS>
Nor are mine cars with thy tongue 's tune delighted , <EOS>
Canst thou O cruel , say I love thee not , <EOS>
I will be true despite thy scythe and thee . <EOS>
And broils root out the work of masonry , <EOS>
Which shall be most my glory being dumb , <EOS>
Nor Mars his sword , nor war 's quick fire shall burn : <EOS>
To weigh how once I suffered in your crime . <EOS>
Making a famine where abundance lies , <EOS>
How much more praise deserved thy beauty 's use , <EOS>
Full many a glorious morning have I seen , <EOS>
Feed'st thy light 's flame with self-substantial fuel , <EOS>
Lascivious grace , in whom all ill well shows , <EOS>
Oaths of thy love , thy truth , thy constancy , <EOS>
In thy soul 's thought ( all naked ) will bestow it : <EOS>
That use is not forbidden usury , <EOS>
The roses fearfully on thorns did stand , <EOS>
And for that riches where is my deserving ? <EOS>
To thy sweet will making addition thus . <EOS>
O no , thy love though much , is not so great , <EOS>
But let your love even with my life decay . <EOS>
O blame me not if I no more can write ! <EOS>
And soon to you , as you to me then tendered <EOS>
Or if they sleep , thy picture in my sight <EOS>
Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind , <EOS>
Or state it self confounded , to decay , <EOS>
Or gluttoning on all , or all away . <EOS>
Of others ' voices , that my adder 's sense , <EOS>
With eager compounds we our palate urge , <EOS>
And many maiden gardens yet unset , <EOS>
Drugs poison him that so feil sick of you . <EOS>
Hath left me , and I desperate now approve , <EOS>
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse , <EOS>
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill , <EOS>
Thou best of dearest , and mine only care , <EOS>
How to divide the conquest of thy sight , <EOS>
Which die for goodness , who have lived for crime . <EOS>
Thou canst not ( love ) disgrace me half so ill , <EOS>
Speaking of worth , what worth in you doth grow . <EOS>
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st , <EOS>
Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky : <EOS>
Under that bond that him as fist doth bind . <EOS>
So I for fear of trust , forget to say , <EOS>
Applying fears to hopes , and hopes to fears , <EOS>
And delves the parallels in beauty 's brow , <EOS>
For thee watch I , whilst thou dost wake elsewhere , <EOS>
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry ? <EOS>
I should in thought control your times of pleasure , <EOS>
Whate'er thy thoughts , or thy heart 's workings be , <EOS>
Those lines that I before have writ do lie , <EOS>
For then despite of space I would be brought , <EOS>
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds , <EOS>
The dear respose for limbs with travel tired , <EOS>
Thy worth the greater being wooed of time , <EOS>
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days ; <EOS>
Thou shouldst print more , not let that copy die . <EOS>
Pity me then , and wish I were renewed , <EOS>
And in abundance addeth to his store , <EOS>
Ah , if thou issueless shalt hap to die , <EOS>
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting , <EOS>
What potions have I drunk of Siren tears <EOS>
The sun it self sees not , till heaven clears . <EOS>
O from what power hast thou this powerful might , <EOS>
Yet seemed it winter still , and you away , <EOS>
My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming , <EOS>
Is lust in action , and till action , lust <EOS>
Looking on darkness which the blind do see . <EOS>
If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks , <EOS>
For we which now behold these present days , <EOS>
With my extern the outward honouring , <EOS>
The other as your bounty doth appear , <EOS>
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross ; <EOS>
A torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed : <EOS>
As easy might I from my self depart , <EOS>
From heaven to hell is flown away . <EOS>
Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive , <EOS>
What is your substance , whereof are you made , <EOS>
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing : <EOS>
For nothing this wide universe I call , <EOS>
Weeds among weeds , or flowers with flowers gathered . <EOS>
But sweet , or colour it had stol'n from thee . <EOS>
Which like a jewel ( hung in ghastly night ) <EOS>
And you in Grecian tires are painted new : <EOS>
From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part , <EOS>
Thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol . <EOS>
Your own glass shows you , when you look in it . <EOS>
That you your self may privilage your time <EOS>
For thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate , <EOS>
The earth can yield me but a common grave , <EOS>
With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st <EOS>
Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue , <EOS>
To make him much outlive a gilded tomb : <EOS>
Finding thy worth a limit past my praise , <EOS>
Make but my name thy love , and love that still , <EOS>
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay : <EOS>
And to his palate doth prepare the cup . <EOS>
Where cheeks need blood , in thee it is abused . <EOS>
Which happies those that pay the willing loan ; <EOS>
And steal dead seeming of his living hue ? <EOS>
To trust those tables that receive thee more : <EOS>
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil : <EOS>
For it depends upon that love of thine . <EOS>
While shadows like to thee do mock my sight ? <EOS>
Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain , <EOS>
But flowers distilled though they with winter meet , <EOS>
Sinks down to death , oppressed with melancholy . <EOS>
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight . <EOS>
And each ( though enemies to either 's reign ) <EOS>
Save thou my rose , in it thou art my all . <EOS>
In things of great receipt with case we prove , <EOS>
if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state ! <EOS>
When what I seek ( my weary travel 's end ) <EOS>
Or durst inhabit on a living brow : <EOS>
It is my love that keeps mine eye awake , <EOS>
As those gold candles fixed in heaven 's air : <EOS>
That followed it as gentle day , <EOS>
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good : <EOS>
Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces . <EOS>
Of this our time , all you prefiguring , <EOS>
Yet nor the lays of birds , nor the sweet smell <EOS>
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse ; <EOS>
If thou wilt leave me , do not leave me last , <EOS>
Why of eyes ' falsehood hast thou forged hooks , <EOS>
And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook <EOS>
Which like a canker in the fragrant rose , <EOS>
To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone , <EOS>
Yet do thy worst old Time : despite thy wrong , <EOS>
Whoe'er keeps me , let my heart be his guard , <EOS>
And then believe me , my love is as fair , <EOS>
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb , <EOS>
For term of life thou art assured mine , <EOS>
Only my plague thus far I count my gain , <EOS>
Who lead thee in their riot even there <EOS>
For all the day they view things unrespected , <EOS>
May time disgrace , and wretched minutes kill . <EOS>
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect , <EOS>
Which husbandry in honour might uphold , <EOS>
Or if it were it bore not beauty 's name : <EOS>
If my dear love were but the child of state , <EOS>
And mock you with me after I am gone . <EOS>
To linger out a purposed overthrow . <EOS>
A bliss in proof and proved , a very woe , <EOS>
My nobler part to my gross body 's treason , <EOS>
For that sweet odour , which doth in it live : <EOS>
Doth half that glory to the sober west <EOS>
No , let me be obsequious in thy heart , <EOS>
Or mine eyes seeing this , say this is not <EOS>
If time have any wrinkle graven there , <EOS>
Then churls their thoughts ( although their eyes were kind ) <EOS>
But that is in my thought , whose love to you <EOS>
When I am sometime absent from thy heart , <EOS>
Make thee another self for love of me , <EOS>
What wretched errors hath my heart committed , <EOS>
Take all my loves , my love , yea take them all , <EOS>
In my love 's veins thou hast too grossly dyed . <EOS>
So far from variation or quick change ? <EOS>
Even so being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness , <EOS>
Resembling sire , and child , and happy mother , <EOS>
All this away , and me most wretchcd make . <EOS>
And found it in thy cheek : he can afford <EOS>
And given to time your own dear-purchased right , <EOS>
Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye , <EOS>
How heavy do I journey on the way , <EOS>
By praising him here who doth hence remain . <EOS>
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st , <EOS>
join with the spite of fortune , make me bow , <EOS>
Or made them swear against the thing they see . <EOS>
Nor services to do till you require . <EOS>
But heavy tears , badges of either 's woe . <EOS>
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose , <EOS>
That thou in losing me , shalt win much glory : <EOS>
Alack what poverty my muse brings forth , <EOS>
A third nor red , nor white , had stol'n of both , <EOS>
The region cloud hath masked him from me now . <EOS>
Then were not summer 's distillation left <EOS>
Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent , <EOS>
Therefore like her , I sometime hold my tongue : <EOS>
Seems seeing , but effectually is out : <EOS>
Thus can my love excuse the slow offence , <EOS>
She carved thee for her seal , and meant thereby , <EOS>
Nature 's bequest gives nothing but doth lend , <EOS>
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend : <EOS>
So is my love still telling what is told . <EOS>
On newer proof , to try an older friend , <EOS>
Eat up thy charge ? is this thy body 's end ? <EOS>
I have no precious time at all to spend ; <EOS>
Which this ( Time 's pencil ) or my pupil pen <EOS>
No news but health from their physicians know . <EOS>
O lest the world should task you to recite , <EOS>
When I consider every thing that grows <EOS>
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand , <EOS>
The worser spirit a woman coloured ill . <EOS>
If hairs be wires , black wires grow on her head : <EOS>
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks , <EOS>
That in the very refuse of thy deeds , <EOS>
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow , <EOS>
But best is best , if never intermixed ' ? <EOS>
Or if it do , not from those lips of thine , <EOS>
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name ! <EOS>
Who with his fear is put beside his part , <EOS>
Than both your poets can in praise devise . <EOS>
Music to hear , why hear'st thou music sadly ? <EOS>
And yet love knows it is a greater grief <EOS>
As I all other in all worths surmount . <EOS>
For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear . <EOS>
Therefore desire ( of perfect'st love being made ) <EOS>
Being your slave what should I do but tend , <EOS>
Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright <EOS>
Could make me any summer 's story tell : <EOS>
Like feeble age he reeleth from the day , <EOS>
Beauty 's effect with beauty were bereft , <EOS>
Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts , <EOS>
And that is this , and this with thee remains . <EOS>
To what it works in , like the dyer 's hand : <EOS>
So now I have confessed that he is thine , <EOS>
Receiving nought by elements so slow , <EOS>
By their rank thoughts , my deeds must not be shown <EOS>
O that our night of woe might have remembered <EOS>
But he that writes of you , if he can tell , <EOS>
To-morrow see again , and do not kill <EOS>
And strength by limping sway disabled <EOS>
And sue a friend , came debtor for my sake , <EOS>
To say within thine own deep sunken eyes , <EOS>
Although thou steal thee all my poverty : <EOS>
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone , <EOS>
And says in him thy fair appearance lies . <EOS>
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger 's jaws , <EOS>
In true plain words , by thy true-telling friend . <EOS>
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard : <EOS>
O how thy worth with manners may I sing , <EOS>
Weary with toil , I haste me to my bed , <EOS>
Thy black is fairest in my judgment 's place . <EOS>
Even of five hundred courses of the sun , <EOS>
Methinks no face so gracious is as mine , <EOS>
Bare ruined choirs , where late the sweet birds sang . <EOS>
Then let not winter 's ragged hand deface , <EOS>
Not by our feeling , but by others ' seeing . <EOS>
Which alters when it alteration finds , <EOS>
But is profaned , if not lives in disgrace . <EOS>
Within the knowledge of mine own desert , <EOS>
Duty so great , which wit so poor as mine <EOS>
No more be grieved at that which thou hast done , <EOS>
Growing a bath and healthful remedy , <EOS>
Let me excuse thee , ah my love well knows , <EOS>
Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure . <EOS>
Or as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground ; <EOS>
Each trifle under truest bars to thrust , <EOS>
Because he needs no praise , wilt thou be dumb ? <EOS>
Is perjured , murd'rous , bloody full of blame , <EOS>
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame , <EOS>
Use power with power , and slay me not by art , <EOS>
When other petty griefs have done their spite , <EOS>
To me fair friend you never can be old , <EOS>
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing . <EOS>
Thy gift , thy tables , are within my brain <EOS>
Like a deceived husband , so love 's face , <EOS>
Which should example where your equal grew . <EOS>
Tibey are the lords and owners of their faces , <EOS>
If it were filled with your most high deserts ? <EOS>
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear . <EOS>
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering ; <EOS>
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen , <EOS>
Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth , <EOS>
Steal from his figure , and no pace perceived , <EOS>
Naming thy name , blesses an ill report . <EOS>
In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes , <EOS>
What thou dost foist upon us that is old , <EOS>
Although she knows my days are past the best , <EOS>
Against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days , <EOS>
Is it thy will , thy image should keep open <EOS>
When love converted from the thing it was <EOS>
Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass , <EOS>
Making dead wood more blest than living lips , <EOS>
Hiding thy brav'ry in their rotten smoke ? <EOS>
What acceptable audit canst thou leave ? <EOS>
Or ( being wrecked ) I am a worthless boat , <EOS>
Of his self-love to stop posterity ? <EOS>
Lilies that fester , smell far worse than weeds . <EOS>
The lily I condemned for thy hand , <EOS>
With others thou shouldst not abhor my state . <EOS>
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell , <EOS>
Nor did I wonder at the lily 's white , <EOS>
Thy proud heart 's slave and vassal wretch to be : <EOS>
Just to the time , not with the time exchanged , <EOS>
Give warning to the world that I am fled <EOS>
When rocks impregnable are not so stout , <EOS>
Entitled in thy parts , do crowned sit , <EOS>
So thou being rich in will add to thy will <EOS>
Divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things : <EOS>
The dedicated words which writers use <EOS>
And for a woman wert thou first created , <EOS>
But not to tell of good , or evil luck , <EOS>
No matter then although my foot did stand <EOS>
But thou art all my art , and dost advance <EOS>
When thou art all the better part of me ? <EOS>
Make answer Muse , wilt thou not haply say , <EOS>
O change thy thought , that I may change my mind , <EOS>
Whose action is no stronger than a flower ? <EOS>
As with your shadow I with these did play . <EOS>
His tender heir might bear his memory : <EOS>
To do more for me than mine own desert , <EOS>
But found no cure , the bath for my help lies , <EOS>
Thy youth 's proud livery so gazed on now , <EOS>
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun , <EOS>
Thine eyes , that taught the dumb on high to sing , <EOS>
Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art , <EOS>
Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom . <EOS>
As to behold desert a beggar born , <EOS>
And saved my life saying 'not you ' . <EOS>
But that so much of earth and water wrought , <EOS>
And 'Will ' to boot , and 'Will ' in over-plus , <EOS>
Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive . <EOS>
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed ? <EOS>
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes ? <EOS>
As a decrepit father takes delight , <EOS>
Roses of shadow , since his rose is true ? <EOS>
That thou no form of thee hast left behind , <EOS>
Either not assailed , or victor being charged , <EOS>
Thou blind fool Love , what dost thou to mine eyes , <EOS>
And there reigns love and all love 's loving parts , <EOS>
Give salutation to my sportive blood ? <EOS>
Now proud as an enjoyer , and anon <EOS>
Admit impediments , love is not love <EOS>
A thousand groans but thinking on thy face , <EOS>
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand , <EOS>
How oft when thou , my music , music play'st , <EOS>
To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame . <EOS>
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell : <EOS>
It suffers not in smiling pomp , nor falls <EOS>
The one doth shadow of your beauty show , <EOS>
In the old age black was not counted fair , <EOS>
Yet then my judgment knew no reason why , <EOS>
Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs , <EOS>
Since saucy jacks so happy are in this , <EOS>
As every alien pen hath got my use , <EOS>
Makes summer 's welcome , thrice more wished , more rare . <EOS>
Thine by thy beauty being false to me . <EOS>
In sleep a king , but waking no such matter . <EOS>
Kind is my love to-day , to-morrow kind , <EOS>
Have put on black , and loving mourners be , <EOS>
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks . <EOS>
The injuries that to my self I do , <EOS>
Can make you live your self in eyes of men . <EOS>
Commit to these waste blanks , and thou shalt find <EOS>
Thy looks with me , thy heart in other place . <EOS>
O him she stores , to show what wealth she had , <EOS>
And hang more praise upon deceased I , <EOS>
For I am shamed by that which I bring forth , <EOS>
My soul doth tell my body that he may , <EOS>
A dateless lively heat still to endure , <EOS>
As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie : <EOS>
So is the time that keeps you as my chest <EOS>
The age to come would say this poet lies , <EOS>
Nor taste , nor smell , desire to be invited <EOS>
Love is a babe , then might I not say so <EOS>
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey <EOS>
As victors of my silence can not boast , <EOS>
Those that can see thou lov'st , and I am blind . <EOS>
And my sick muse doth give an other place . <EOS>
And needy nothing trimmed in jollity , <EOS>
'Gainst death , and all-oblivious enmity <EOS>
And having thee , of all men 's pride I boast . <EOS>
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting , <EOS>
That heaven 's air in this huge rondure hems . <EOS>
My love looks fresh , and death to me subscribes , <EOS>
This silence for my sin you did impute , <EOS>
Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising , <EOS>
Or ten times happier be it ten for one , <EOS>
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds , <EOS>
And though they be outstripped by every pen , <EOS>
Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song , <EOS>
Tempteth my better angel from my side , <EOS>
Ere you were born was beauty 's summer dead . <EOS>
And other strains of woe , which now seem woe , <EOS>
One on another 's neck do witness bear <EOS>
Than public means which public manners breeds . <EOS>
O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose ! <EOS>
I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief <EOS>
If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show . <EOS>
After a thousand victories once foiled , <EOS>
For all that beauty that doth cover thee , <EOS>
And what is't but mine own when I praise thee ? <EOS>
And her quietus is to render thee . <EOS>
Among a number one is reckoned none . <EOS>
How far a modern quill doth come too short , <EOS>
That on himself such murd'rous shame commits . <EOS>
For men discased , but I my mistress ' thrall , <EOS>
The soil is this , that thou dost common grow . <EOS>
Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee , <EOS>
I see descriptions of the fairest wights , <EOS>
To make me give the lie to my true sight , <EOS>
And being frank she lends to those are free : <EOS>
Since spite of him I 'll live in this poor rhyme , <EOS>
Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds <EOS>
Painting my age with beauty of thy days . <EOS>
For when these quicker elements are gone <EOS>
To witness duty , not to show my wit . <EOS>
Than when it hath my added praise beside . <EOS>
And purest faith unhappily forsworn , <EOS>
And suit thy pity like in every part . <EOS>
Which should transport me farthest from your sight . <EOS>
O give thy self the thanks if aught in me , <EOS>
And by a part of all thy glory live : <EOS>
Come in the rearward of a conquered woe , <EOS>
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back , <EOS>
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud . <EOS>
Who heaven it self for ornament doth use , <EOS>
To be so tickled they would change their state <EOS>
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night , <EOS>
And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness , <EOS>
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day ? <EOS>
And husband nature 's riches from expense , <EOS>
Which shall above that idle rank remain <EOS>
When I ( perhaps ) compounded am with clay , <EOS>
You live in this , and dwell in lovers ' eyes . <EOS>
Crawls to maturity , wherewith being crowned , <EOS>
'T is not enough that through the cloud thou break , <EOS>
By children 's eyes , her husband 's shape in mind : <EOS>
The painful warrior famoused for fight , <EOS>
To work my mind , when body 's work 's expired . <EOS>
To this composed wonder of your frame , <EOS>
And in some perfumes is there more delight , <EOS>
I guess one angel in another 's hell . <EOS>
Why should false painting imitate his cheek , <EOS>
When in disgrace with Fortune and men 's eyes , <EOS>
But thence I learn and find the lesson true , <EOS>
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory , <EOS>
Pity me then dear friend , and I assure ye , <EOS>
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love ? <EOS>
And wear their brave state out of memory . <EOS>
Or at the least , so long as brain and heart <EOS>
Or whether revolution be the same . <EOS>
Therefore my verse to constancy confined , <EOS>
That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds ? <EOS>
Die to themselves . Sweet roses do not so , <EOS>
But wherefore says she not she is unjust ? <EOS>
And puts apparel on my tattered loving , <EOS>
Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble , <EOS>
There is such strength and warrantise of skill , <EOS>
Resembling strong youth in his middle age , <EOS>
If not from my love 's breath ? The purple pride <EOS>
But if the while I think on thee ( dear friend ) <EOS>
Though in our lives a separable spite , <EOS>
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are : <EOS>
That you for love speak well of me untrue , <EOS>
When thou reviewest this , thou dost review , <EOS>
That time of year thou mayst in me behold , <EOS>
In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn , <EOS>
And moan th ' expense of many a vanished sight . <EOS>
To know my shames and praises from your tongue , <EOS>
To this I witness call the fools of time , <EOS>
By those swift messengers returned from thee , <EOS>
Make sweet some vial ; treasure thou some place , <EOS>
What merit do I in my self respect , <EOS>
Which works on leases of short-numbered hours , <EOS>
Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day , <EOS>
Lest sorrow lend me words and words express , <EOS>
That she that makes me sin , awards me pain . <EOS>
But beauty 's waste hath in the world an end , <EOS>
For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings , <EOS>
Then happy I that love and am beloved <EOS>
And look upon my self and curse my fate , <EOS>
Which on thy soft check for complexion dwells , <EOS>
And place my merit in the eye of scorn , <EOS>
Like him that travels I return again , <EOS>
For thou art covetous , and he is kind , <EOS>
Desire is death , which physic did except . <EOS>
Thou mayst call thine , when thou from youth convertest , <EOS>
Why should he live , now nature bankrupt is , <EOS>
To entertain the time with thoughts of love , <EOS>
At first the very worst of fortune 's might . <EOS>
Making no summer of another 's green , <EOS>
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake , <EOS>
And my next self thou harder hast engrossed , <EOS>
But as the riper should by time decease , <EOS>
Alas 't is true , I have gone here and there , <EOS>
Let them say more that like of hearsay well , <EOS>
To mar the subject that before was well ? <EOS>
That sin by him advantage should achieve , <EOS>
Consumed with that which it was nourished by . <EOS>
Whilst I ( my sovereign ) watch the clock for you , <EOS>
That may express my love , or thy dear merit ? <EOS>
To every hymn that able spirit affords , <EOS>
Prison my heart in thy steel bosom 's ward , <EOS>
Needs must I under my transgression bow , <EOS>
Mine appetite I never more will grind <EOS>
That I have frequent been with unknown minds , <EOS>
Shifts but his place , for still the world enjoys it ; <EOS>
My self corrupting salving thy amiss , <EOS>
This thou perceiv'st , which makes thy love more strong , <EOS>
Made more or less by thy continual haste : <EOS>
Even such a beauty as you master now . <EOS>
Show me your image in some antique book , <EOS>
For through the painter must you see his skill , <EOS>
Awakes my heart , to heart 's and eye 's delight . <EOS>
To me are nothing novel , nothing strange , <EOS>
For you in me can nothing worthy prove . <EOS>
And like enough thou know'st thy estimate , <EOS>
But that thou none lov'st is most evident : <EOS>
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take , <EOS>
We sicken to shun sickness when we purge . <EOS>
Since what he owes thee , thou thy self dost pay . <EOS>
No bitterness that I will bitter think , <EOS>
But those same tongues that give thee so thine own , <EOS>
Holds in perfection but a little moment . <EOS>
They live unwooed , and unrespected fade , <EOS>
They were but sweet , but figures of delight : <EOS>
All these I better in one general best . <EOS>
These present-absent with swift motion slide . <EOS>
So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will , <EOS>
And yet it may be said I loved her dearly , <EOS>
And by addition me of thee defeated , <EOS>
That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide , <EOS>
And prove thee virtuous , though thou art forsworn : <EOS>
So should my papers ( yellowed with their age ) <EOS>
For having traffic with thy self alone , <EOS>
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies , <EOS>
When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow <EOS>
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments , <EOS>
Lose all , and more by paying too much rent <EOS>
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving , <EOS>
I make my love engrafted to this store : <EOS>
Profitless usurer why dost thou use <EOS>
When in the chronicle of wasted time , <EOS>
The forward violet thus did I chide , <EOS>
My mistress ' eyes are nothing like the sun , <EOS>
But when in thee time 's furrows I behold , <EOS>
And 'gainst my self a lawful plea commence : <EOS>
Which to repair should be thy chief desire : <EOS>
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime , <EOS>
Of more delight than hawks and horses be : <EOS>
My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie , <EOS>
If I lose thee , my loss is my love 's gain , <EOS>
But all alone stands hugely politic , <EOS>
She keeps thee to this purpose , that her skill <EOS>
To find where your true image pictured lies , <EOS>
When I against my self with thee partake ? <EOS>
Suns of the world may stain , when heaven 's sun staineth . <EOS>
When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover <EOS>
When tyrants ' crests and tombs of brass are spent . <EOS>
Coral is far more red , than her lips red , <EOS>
The mountain , or the sea , the day , or night : <EOS>
And situation with those dancing chips , <EOS>
O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove , <EOS>
Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting , <EOS>
The scope and tenure of thy jealousy ? <EOS>
Too base of thee to be remembered , <EOS>
And life no longer than thy love will stay , <EOS>
No , neither he , nor his compeers by night <EOS>
Which labouring for invention bear amis <EOS>
Since every one , hath every one , one shade , <EOS>
And then thou lov'st me for my name is Will . <EOS>
Ere beauty 's dead fleece made another gay : <EOS>
Though not to love , yet love to tell me so , <EOS>
And all the rest forgot for which he toiled : <EOS>
Him in thy course untainted do allow , <EOS>
But reckoning time , whose millioned accidents <EOS>
And do not drop in for an after-loss : <EOS>
Crowning the present , doubting of the rest ? <EOS>
And for this sin there is no remedy , <EOS>
Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel . <EOS>
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate <EOS>
Or any of these all , or all , or more <EOS>
A man in hue all hues in his controlling , <EOS>
And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair , <EOS>
Return of love , more blest may be the view . <EOS>
Such is my love , to thee I so belong , <EOS>
To march in ranks of better equipage : <EOS>
What merit lived in me that you should love <EOS>
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love , <EOS>
If it be poisoned , 't is the lesser sin , <EOS>
Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye , <EOS>
In so profound abysm I throw all care <EOS>
From where thou art , why should I haste me thence ? <EOS>
Some say thy fault is youth , some wantonness , <EOS>
O though I love what others do abhor , <EOS>
O cunning love , with tears thou keep'st me blind , <EOS>
Though in thy store 's account I one must be , <EOS>
Which proves more short than waste or ruining ? <EOS>
And in his thoughts of love doth share a part . <EOS>
From thy behaviour , beauty doth he give <EOS>
When I have seen by Time 's fell hand defaced <EOS>
And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear , <EOS>
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought , <EOS>
Which though it alter not love 's sole effect , <EOS>
And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness , <EOS>
From me far off , with others all too near . <EOS>
He lends thee virtue , and he stole that word , <EOS>
Your love and pity doth th ' impression fill , <EOS>
To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way , <EOS>
And I by this will be a gainer too , <EOS>
Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well . <EOS>
Who moving others , are themselves as stone , <EOS>
Doth teach that case and that repose to say <EOS>
And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent . <EOS>
He of tall building , and of goodly pride . <EOS>
And all my soul , and all my every part ; <EOS>
To say they err , I dare not be so bold , <EOS>
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair <EOS>
Till I return of posting is no need . <EOS>
Were to import forgetfulness in me . <EOS>
Can not dispraise , but in a kind of praise , <EOS>
To make him seem long hence , as he shows now . <EOS>
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life , <EOS>
That leaves look pale , dreading the winter 's near . <EOS>
Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse , <EOS>
A crow that flies in heaven 's sweetest air . <EOS>
And frantic-mad with evermore unrest , <EOS>
Though absence seemed my flame to qualify , <EOS>
For what care I who calls me well or ill , <EOS>
When you have bid your servant once adieu . <EOS>
Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find . <EOS>
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell , <EOS>
Both grace and faults are loved of more and less : <EOS>
Pity the world , or else this glutton be , <EOS>
Nor double penance to correct correction . <EOS>
To the wide world and all her fading sweets : <EOS>
No , I am that I am , and they that level <EOS>
I was not sick of any fear from thence . <EOS>
Yet in good faith some say that thee behold , <EOS>
Which is not mixed with seconds , knows no art , <EOS>
Roses have thorns , and silver fountains mud , <EOS>
That thou among the wastes of time must go , <EOS>
For beauty 's pattern to succeeding men . <EOS>
It is the star to every wand'ring bark , <EOS>
And right perfection wrongfully disgraced , <EOS>
Although our undivided loves are one : <EOS>
And him as for a map doth Nature store , <EOS>
So thou prevent'st his scythe , and crooked knife . <EOS>
What 's new to speak , what now to register , <EOS>
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief , <EOS>
Since all alike my songs and praises be <EOS>
And my heart 's right , thy inward love of heart . <EOS>
'Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed , <EOS>
My body is the frame wherein 't is held , <EOS>
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er <EOS>
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me , <EOS>
That poor retention could not so much hold , <EOS>
No longer yours , than you your self here live , <EOS>
Thou by thy dial 's shady stealth mayst know , <EOS>
To be death 's conquest and make worms thine heir . <EOS>
Some in their wealth , some in their body 's force , <EOS>
That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him . <EOS>
Feeds on the rarities of nature 's truth , <EOS>
In tender embassy of love to thee , <EOS>
That every tongue says beauty should look so . <EOS>
Where Cupid got new fire ; my mistress ' eyes . <EOS>
And to his robbery had annexed thy breath , <EOS>
Grant if thou wilt , thou art beloved of many , <EOS>
Like stones of worth they thinly placed are , <EOS>
For fear of which , hear this thou age unbred , <EOS>
Like widowed wombs after their lords ' decease : <EOS>
Thy self thou gav'st , thy own worth then not knowing , <EOS>
The right of sepulchres , were shorn away , <EOS>
Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother ; <EOS>
With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers , <EOS>
O that you were your self , but love you are <EOS>
So run'st thou after that which flies from thee , <EOS>
The spirit of love , with a perpetual dulness : <EOS>
That is my home of love , if I have ranged , <EOS>
The humble as the proudest sail doth bear , <EOS>
As Philomel in summer 's front doth sing , <EOS>
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone , <EOS>
Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye , <EOS>
Lest the wise world should look into your moan , <EOS>
What 's in the brain that ink may character , <EOS>
Knowing a better spirit doth use your name , <EOS>
To critic and to flatterer stopped are : <EOS>
But weep to have , that which it fears to lose . <EOS>
How like a winter hath my absence been <EOS>
Death 's second self that seals up all in rest . <EOS>
Increasing store with loss , and loss with store . <EOS>
Of plagues , of dearths , or seasons ' quality , <EOS>
And stops her pipe in growth of riper days : <EOS>
When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade , <EOS>
You are my all the world , and I must strive , <EOS>
Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where : <EOS>
Which three till now , never kept seat in one . <EOS>
For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure . <EOS>
To any sensual feast with thee alone : <EOS>
Love is too young to know what conscience is , <EOS>
By looking on thee in the living day , <EOS>
To one , of one , still such , and ever so . <EOS>
Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross , <EOS>
Shall worms inheritors of this excess <EOS>
When you entombed in men 's eyes shall lie , <EOS>
If I could write the beauty of your eyes , <EOS>
Who hateth thee that I do call my friend , <EOS>
Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure , <EOS>
So should that beauty which you hold in lease <EOS>
But were some child of yours alive that time , <EOS>
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give , <EOS>
To play the watchman ever for thy sake . <EOS>
No longer mourn for me when I am dead , <EOS>
For I impair not beauty being mute , <EOS>
Can yet the lease of my true love control , <EOS>
Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life , <EOS>
Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee , <EOS>
With sun and moon , with earth and sea 's rich gems : <EOS>
For thee , and for my self , no quiet find . <EOS>
Or if they sing , 't is with so dull a cheer , <EOS>
Haply I think on thee , and then my state , <EOS>
Wretched in this alone , that thou mayst take , <EOS>
Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still : <EOS>
And for the peace of you I hold such strife <EOS>
The earth can have but earth , which is his due , <EOS>
Were it not sinful then striving to mend , <EOS>
Give not a windy night a rainy morrow , <EOS>
Or if they have , where is my judgment fled , <EOS>
To change your day of youth to sullied night , <EOS>
Shall reasons find of settled gravity ; <EOS>
When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even . <EOS>
As an unperfect actor on the stage , <EOS>
Which I by lacking have supposed dead , <EOS>
Nothing sweet boy , but yet like prayers divine , <EOS>
That for thy right , my self will bear all wrong . <EOS>
Alas why fearing of time 's tyranny , <EOS>
And wherefore say not I that I am old ? <EOS>
And simple truth miscalled simplicity , <EOS>
Love 's eye is not so true as all men 's : no , <EOS>
I may not evermore acknowledge thee , <EOS>
Whereto th ' inviting time our fashion calls : <EOS>
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote , <EOS>
While comments of your praise richly compiled , <EOS>
Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary <EOS>
O lest your true love may seem false in this , <EOS>
I must attend , time 's leisure with my moan . <EOS>
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be . <EOS>
And made my self a motley to the view , <EOS>
What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might <EOS>
Delights to peep , to gaze therein on thee ; <EOS>
Herein lives wisdom , beauty , and increase , <EOS>
The other two , slight air , and purging fire , <EOS>
As on the finger of a throned queen , <EOS>
Thou that art now the world 's fresh ornament , <EOS>
Thy self away , art present still with me , <EOS>
Of his quick objects hath the mind no part , <EOS>
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more , <EOS>
That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong . <EOS>
My saucy bark ( inferior far to his ) <EOS>
Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth : <EOS>
Nor that full star that ushers in the even <EOS>
As truth and beauty shall together thrive <EOS>
My heavy eyelids to the weary night ? <EOS>
That am debarred the benefit of rest ? <EOS>
And take thou my oblation , poor but free , <EOS>
Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious , <EOS>
In polished form of well refined pen . <EOS>
And yet thou wilt , for I being pent in thee , <EOS>
Comes home again , on better judgement making . <EOS>
O how shall summer 's honey breath hold out , <EOS>
For thee , against my self I 'll vow debate , <EOS>
Since brass , nor stone , nor earth , nor boundless sea , <EOS>
In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled : <EOS>
Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault , <EOS>
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth , <EOS>
And our dear love lose name of single one , <EOS>
Love 's not Time 's fool , though rosy lips and cheeks <EOS>
And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine , <EOS>
But makes antiquity for aye his page , <EOS>
As any mother 's child , though not so bright <EOS>
Each changing place with that which goes before , <EOS>
And I am still with them , and they with thee . <EOS>
And I a tyrant have no leisure taken <EOS>
To guard the lawful reasons on thy part , <EOS>
Under the blow of thralled discontent , <EOS>
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned , <EOS>
The second burthen of a former child ! <EOS>
What strained touches rhetoric can lend , <EOS>
But rising at thy name doth point out thee , <EOS>
As he takes from you , I engraft you new . <EOS>
But sad mortality o'ersways their power , <EOS>
Who will believe my verse in time to come <EOS>
You are so strongly in my purpose bred , <EOS>
Grows fairer than at first , more strong , far greater . <EOS>
By chance , or nature 's changing course untrimmed : <EOS>
So either by thy picture or my love , <EOS>
And thou ( all they ) hast all the all of me . <EOS>
More worthy I to be beloved of thee . <EOS>
Who all in one , one pleasing note do sing : <EOS>
Like as to make our appetite more keen <EOS>
Past cure I am , now reason is past care , <EOS>
But when from highmost pitch with weary car , <EOS>
The bounteous largess given thee to give ? <EOS>
It fears not policy that heretic , <EOS>
The teeming autumn big with rich increase , <EOS>
I may be straight though they themselves be bevel ; <EOS>
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds , <EOS>
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand , <EOS>
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme , <EOS>
And ruined love when it is built anew <EOS>
Is it for fear to wet a widow 's eye , <EOS>
They are but dressings Of a former sight : <EOS>
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be . <EOS>
For bending all my loving thoughts on thee , <EOS>
O'ercharged with burthen of mine own love 's might : <EOS>
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night , <EOS>
And to be praised of ages yet to be . <EOS>
Called to that audit by advised respects , <EOS>
O learn to read what silent love hath writ , <EOS>
O what a mansion have those vices got , <EOS>
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold . <EOS>
But for their virtue only is their show , <EOS>
No it was builded far from accident , <EOS>
Ten times thy self were happier than thou art , <EOS>
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow . <EOS>
Lo as a careful huswife runs to catch , <EOS>
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit ; <EOS>
Came there for cure and this by that I prove , <EOS>
If any , be a satire to decay , <EOS>
My self I 'll forfeit , so that other mine , <EOS>
And make me travel forth without my cloak , <EOS>
Am of my self , all-tyrant , for thy sake ? <EOS>
Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed . <EOS>
Which in my bosom 's shop is hanging still , <EOS>
For I have sworn thee fair , and thought thee bright , <EOS>
Reserve their character with golden quill , <EOS>
Sweet flattery , then she loves but me alone . <EOS>
If like a lamb he could his looks translate ! <EOS>
I have seen roses damasked , red and white , <EOS>
Praising thy worth , despite his cruel hand . <EOS>
Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days . <EOS>
With ugly rack on his celestial face , <EOS>
With all triumphant splendour on my brow , <EOS>
'Had my friend 's Muse grown with this growing age , <EOS>
More sharp to me than spurring to his side , <EOS>
No shape so true , no truth of such account , <EOS>
Therefore my mistress ' eyes are raven black , <EOS>
Nativity once in the main of light , <EOS>
Even to thy pure and most most loving breast . <EOS>
When I have seen such interchange of State , <EOS>
My grief lies onward and my joy behind . <EOS>
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done , <EOS>
Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie , <EOS>
Who hast by waning grown , and therein show'st , <EOS>
A woman 's face with nature 's own hand painted , <EOS>
O truant Muse what shall be thy amends , <EOS>
With shifting change as is false women 's fashion , <EOS>
Hath travelled on to age 's steepy night , <EOS>
But as the marigold at the sun 's eye , <EOS>
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife , <EOS>
And folly ( doctor-like ) controlling skill , <EOS>
Nor thou with public kindness honour me , <EOS>
And to the painted banquet bids my heart : <EOS>
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast , <EOS>
Finding the first conceit of love there bred , <EOS>
Then give me welcome , next my heaven the best , <EOS>
The living record of your memory . <EOS>
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east , <EOS>
Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad , <EOS>
How careful was I when I took my way , <EOS>
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew ? <EOS>
Since I left you , mine eye is in my mind , <EOS>
Which from Love 's fire took heat perpetual , <EOS>
If thy soul check thee that I come so near , <EOS>
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine ? <EOS>
Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day , <EOS>
O love 's best habit is in seeming trust , <EOS>
But day by night and night by day oppressed . <EOS>
Of thy fair health , recounting it to me . <EOS>
So long lives this , and this gives life to thee . <EOS>
Those parts of thee that the world 's eye doth view , <EOS>
Rise resty Muse , my love 's sweet face survey , <EOS>
As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found . <EOS>
But things removed that hidden in thee lie . <EOS>
Compare them with the bett'ring of the time , <EOS>
For as the sun is daily new and old , <EOS>
Are both with thee , wherever I abide , <EOS>
Calls back the lovely April of her prime , <EOS>
How many lambs might the stern wolf betray , <EOS>
Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent ? <EOS>
Such civil war is in my love and hate , <EOS>
But love , for love , thus shall excuse my jade , <EOS>
Towards thee I 'll run , and give him leave to go . <EOS>
I will acquaintance strangle and look strange : <EOS>
But shoot not at me in your wakened hate : <EOS>
They had not skill enough your worth to sing : <EOS>
The coward conquest of a wretch 's knife , <EOS>
Speak of the spring , and foison of the year , <EOS>
( Though words come hindmost ) holds his rank before , <EOS>
So are those errors that in thee are seen , <EOS>
And you in every blessed shape we know . <EOS>
Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow , <EOS>
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood , <EOS>
My thoughts and my discourse as mad men 's are , <EOS>
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth . <EOS>
Be as thy presence is gracious and kind , <EOS>
And darkly bright , are bright in dark directed . <EOS>
But out alack , he was but one hour mine , <EOS>
Have faculty by nature to subsist , <EOS>
Look whom she best endowed , she gave thee more ; <EOS>
Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection , <EOS>
Which for their habitation chose out thee , <EOS>
When yellow leaves , or none , or few do hang <EOS>
Who in despite of view is pleased to dote . <EOS>
So are you to my thoughts as food to life , <EOS>
These blenches gave my heart another youth , <EOS>
So you o'er-green my bad , my good allow ? <EOS>
And fortify your self in your decay <EOS>
Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb <EOS>
Savage , extreme , rude , cruel , not to trust , <EOS>
Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son . <EOS>
Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee , <EOS>
Tan sacred beauty , blunt the sharp'st intents , <EOS>
Be where you list , your charter is so strong , <EOS>
Unlearned in the world 's false subtleties . <EOS>
When beauty lived and died as flowers do now , <EOS>
'I hate ' , from hate away she threw , <EOS>
And will thy soul knows is admitted there , <EOS>
Will play the tyrants to the very same , <EOS>
And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill . <EOS>
Gentle thou art , and therefore to be won , <EOS>
I grant ( sweet love ) thy lovely argument <EOS>
To show false Art what beauty was of yore . <EOS>
Which many legions of true hearts had warmed , <EOS>
Others , but stewards of their excellence : <EOS>
Against my love shall be as I am now <EOS>
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain : <EOS>
Most worthy comfort , now my greatest grief , <EOS>
Thine own sweet argument , too excellent , <EOS>
Even for this , let us divided live , <EOS>
And by their verdict is determined <EOS>
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan <EOS>
With what I most enjoy contented least , <EOS>
So shall I live , supposing thou art true , <EOS>
No praise to thee , but what in thee doth live . <EOS>
Why so large cost having so short a lease , <EOS>
Hath been before , how are our brains beguiled , <EOS>
Even in the eyes of all posterity <EOS>
At such who not born fair no beauty lack , <EOS>
One will of mine to make thy large will more . <EOS>
May still seem love to me , though altered new : <EOS>
But hope of orphans , and unfathered fruit , <EOS>
And in themselves their pride lies buried , <EOS>
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend ? <EOS>
But thy eternal summer shall not fade , <EOS>
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear : <EOS>
That over-goes my blunt invention quite , <EOS>
In many 's looks , the false heart 's history <EOS>
So far from home into my deeds to pry , <EOS>
There lives more life in one of your fair eyes , <EOS>
Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love , <EOS>
Look in your glass and there appears a face , <EOS>
As subject to time 's love or to time 's hate , <EOS>
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive , <EOS>
Against that time ( if ever that time come ) <EOS>
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell ; <EOS>
I am to wait , though waiting so be hell , <EOS>
By seeing farther than the eye hath shown . <EOS>
For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness : <EOS>
Which I new pay as if not paid before . <EOS>
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour <EOS>
My deepest sense , how hard true sorrow hits , <EOS>
In the distraction of this madding fever ! <EOS>
When my love swears that she is made of truth , <EOS>
Upon thy side , against my self I 'll fight , <EOS>
My love shall in my verse ever live young . <EOS>
